    "And this is what a python dictionary is. But you aren't using microsoft word\n",

    "    \"Alpha\":\"01/01/2000\",\n",
    "    \"Beta\":\"02/02/2022\",\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, to 'pull out a draw', we'd specify what label/key we're opening, and\n",
    "python returns the contents\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "betasBirthday = familycabinet[\"Beta\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You strictly have to know that `dictionary[key]` only tells python to open\n",
    "the draw of that `dictionary` that has the label `key`. Python will cry and\n",
    "throw a tantrum if it can't find that `key` (it'll raise an exception).\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can be more clear in your instructions. In python, you can use something\n",

    "\n",
    "If you look into the python documentation, it would tell you that the method\n",
    "for dict called `get` will attempt to retreive the value for the key given,\n",
    "and will default to None if it doesn't find it, unless you provide a default\n",
    "for it to return:\n",

    "It's important to remember from the analogy that a dictionary value can only\n",
    "be one item. That doesn't mean that one item can't be a list or a dictionary\n",
    "which contains more items, because that is technically still *one* item.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of it is that each key can only point to one value.\n",
    "\n",
    "And just like in the filing cabinet analogy, you can't see the contents until\n",
    "you open up the draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "For python, if you wanted to open the draws up, you'd use a loop combined with\n",
    "one of three generators for dictionaries: `somedict.keys()` to loop over all\n",
    "the keys or *labels* of the dictionary; `somedict.values()` to loop over all\n",
    "the values or *contents* of the dictionary; `somedict.items()` to loop over\n",
    "all the keys and values in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the example of:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "key in cart.keys(): \n",
    "  fulfillment_cart[key] = [cart[key]] + aisle_mapping[key]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What is happening is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We loop over all the keys/label in the `cart` dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We then access the value in fulfillment_cart with one of those keys from (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We then change the value we retrieved from the fulfillment_cart to equal\n",
    "a list\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The list is equal to the value/contents of the key from (1) in `cart` and the\n",
    "value/contents of the key from (1) in `aisle_mapping`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So from this logic, you might see that while we are looping over the keys, we are\n",
    "using those keys to actually access the values of a different dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we're looping over the key, and then using that key to access the value\n",
    "from the same dictionary (`cart`). As mentioned before, we can use the generator\n",
    "`.items()` to loop over all the keys and values in a tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for key, value in cart.items():\n",
    "    fulfillment_cart[key] = [value] + aisle_mapping[key]\n",
